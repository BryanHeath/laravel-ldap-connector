This package is a fork of DsDevbe's package (https://github.com/dsdevbe/ldap-connector)

# Ldap-connector
Provides an solution for authentication users with LDAP for Laravel 5.0.x. It uses ADLDAP library to create a bridge between Laravel and LDAP

## Installation
1. Install this package through Composer for Laravel v5.0:
    ```js
    composer require T3chn0crat/laravel-ldap-connector:dev
    ```

1. Change the authentication driver in the Laravel config to use the ldap driver. You can find this in the following file `config/auth.php`

    ```php
    'driver' => 'ldap',
    ```
1. Create a new configuration file `ldap.php` in the configuration folder of Laravel `app/config/ldap.php` and modify to your needs. For more detail of the configuration you can always check on [ADLAP documentation](http://adldap.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation_configuration)
    
    ```
    return array(
    	'account_suffix'=>  "@domain.local",
    	'domain_controllers'=>  array("192.168.0.1", "dc02.domain.local"), // Load balancing domain controllers
    	'base_dn'   =>  'DC=domain,DC=local',
    );
    ```
1. Once this is done you arrived at the final step and you will need to add a service provider. Open `config/app.php`, and add a new item to the providers array.
	
	```
	'T3chn0crat\LdapConnector\LdapConnectorServiceProvider'
	```

## Usage
The LDAP plugin is an extension of the AUTH class and will act the same as normal usage with Eloquent driver.
    
    ```
    if (Auth::attempt(array('username' => $email, 'password' => $password)))
    {
        return Redirect::intended('dashboard');
    }
    ```

You can find more examples on [Laravel Auth Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/master/authentication) on using the `Auth::` function.
